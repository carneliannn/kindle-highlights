Most types of bacterial cells do not have genetic systems (such as homologous recombination) that are found in yeast and E. coli. As a result it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make substantial genetic changes to the majority of bacterial genomes. This is one of the reasons most scientists work with E. coli: they do so simply because they can.

Dan had realized that the exonucleases that cut back one strand of DNA do not compete with the DNA polymerase that we used to fill in missing bases of DNA. Also, when all the enzymes are combined in a single reaction at fifty degrees centigrade, the exonuclease is rapidly inactivated at this temperature and therefore can chew back only enough bases to allow the DNA fragments to anneal with each other.

It was not until 1982, when Thomas Cech, at the University of Colorado, Boulder, showed that an RNA molecule could self-splice out an intron,20 together with the discovery by Sidney Altman, at Yale University, of the catalytic properties of ribonuclease P,21 which can cut RNA, that we knew for sure that these catalytic RNAs—“ribozymes”—actually existed. Cech and Altman shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discoveries.22

Using synthetic RNAs and radioactively labeled amino acids, they discovered that three uracil's, UUU, formed the codon for the amino acid phenylalanine.

One of the more famous attempts to grapple with issues raised by synthetic life forms can be found in the Three Laws of Robotics, which were devised by the science-fiction author Isaac Asimov and first appeared in 1942 in his short story “Runaround”: “1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.” Asimov would later add a fourth, “the zeroth law,” to precede the others: “0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”

Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness … focusing the consciousness … aortal dilation … avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness … to be conscious by choice … blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions … one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone … animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct … the animal destroys and does not produce … animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual … the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe … focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid … bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs … all things/cells/beings are impermanent … strive for flow-permanence within …
